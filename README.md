# âš¡ Electrical Lining using Kruskal's & Prim's Algorithms

This Java project demonstrates how to connect all houses in a town with electric lines using the **least total wire length**. It uses two well-known graph algorithms: **Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm** and **Primâ€™s Algorithm** to find the **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**, ensuring all houses are connected efficiently.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

You are given a number of houses (nodes) and possible connections between them with wire lengths (edge weights). Your goal is to connect all houses in such a way that:

- Every house is connected (directly or indirectly),
- The total wire length is **minimum**,
- No cycles are formed (to avoid redundancy or extra cost).

This is solved using **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** algorithms.

---

## ðŸ”§ Algorithms Used

- **Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm**: Sorts all edges in increasing order of weight and selects the shortest ones that donâ€™t form a cycle using Union-Find.
- **Primâ€™s Algorithm**: Starts from any house and expands the MST by choosing the smallest weight edge that connects a new house.

### ðŸ–¥ Requirements:
- Java Development Kit (JDK 8 or above)
- Terminal / Command Prompt

### ðŸ”§ Steps:

1. Save the following files in the same directory:
   - `Main.java`
   - `PrimMST.java`
   - `KruskalMST.java`

2. Open terminal/command prompt in the directory and run:

```bash
javac Main.java PrimMST.java KruskalMST.java
java Main
