--- Prim's Algorithm ---
House 0 - House 1  = 2
House 1 - House 2  = 3
House 1 - House 4  = 5
House 0 - House 3  = 6
Minimum total wire length: 16

--- Kruskal's Algorithm ---
Edges in MST:
House 0 - House 1 = 2
House 1 - House 2 = 3
House 1 - House 4 = 5
House 0 - House 3 = 6
Minimum total wire length: 16
